# Config-based Agent Sample - Sequential and Loop Workflow

A multi-agent setup with a sequential and loop workflow.

The whole process is:

1. An initial writing agent will author a 1-2 sentence as starting point.
2. A critic agent will review and provide feedback.
3. A refiner agent will revise based on critic agent's feedback.
4. Loop back to #2 until critic agent says "No major issues found."

> initial topic: badminton

> initial topic: AI hurts human
